SymLinker

*Released under the GNU General Public License version 3 by J2897.*

Pass it a source folder, and a destination, and a copy will be created. But instead of copying the files, symbolic links will be created instead.

*This has now been successfully tested on both 32-Bit and 64-Bit versions of Windows 7.*
